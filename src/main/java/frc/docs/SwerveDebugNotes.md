Looking at the shaft defines inversion direction of motors (both talon and kraken)

coordinate field: NW up, Counter Clockwise positive

Clockwise pos on turn motors matches Clockwise pos on CAN coders

Drive still moves in reverse, but a change in clockwise pos makes them unstable

expectation is direction of drive motor should not impact rotation calc at all
